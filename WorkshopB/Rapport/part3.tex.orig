Since the plant have a transfer function as,
\begin{equation}
  G_o(s)=\frac{25.15}{s+2.157}
\end{equation}
<<<<<<< HEAD
and that an $A_m(s)$ of same order as the plant should be chosen, the
following functions was used,

and an $A_m(s)$ of same order should be choosen, the following functions is
used,

\begin{align*}
    A_m(s)=s+\omega_1 \\
    A_o(s)=s+\omega_2
\end{align*}
with
\begin{align*}
    \omega_1 = 10 \\
<<<<<<< HEAD
    \omega_2 = 5.
\end{align*}
These values gives the plot seen in figure \ref{fig:sens31org}.

When the poles for $A_0(s)$ is increased to five times $A_m(s)$ the
results in figure \ref{fig:sens31fast} is obtained.

\end{figure}
From the plots we can see that there is a possibility to adjust the
system to be less sensitive to noise and disturbances from either the
sensor or the plant. This means that if there is a good plant model,
there is less sensitivity to sensor noise.

system to be less sensitive to noice and disturbances from eather the
sensor or the plant. This means that if there is a good plant model,
there is moore room for sensornoice.
