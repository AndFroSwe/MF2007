\section*{Parameter identification}
This section covers the methods behind finding the parameters to enter into the
model to get the biggest similarity to the physical plant
\subsection*{Level 1}
To identify the parameters of the DC motor, firstly an idealized model is
studied theoretically to understand which physical parameters that affect the
performance of the motor. In the Laplace frequency domain, a model of the motor
without inductance can be expressed as 
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:motormodel}
    X = \frac {k (1 + \frac{1}{Rd})} {s \frac {J_t} { \frac {k^2} {R} + d} + 1}
    U,
\end{equation}
where $X$ is the rotational speed, $U$ is the input voltage, $k$, $R$ and $d$
are the electric motor constant, internal resistance and the viscous friction.
The variable $J_t$ represents the total inertia of the motor and the load. With
the load inertia after a gear with gear ratio $n$, the total inertia is
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:inertia}
    J_t = J + \frac{J_{load}}{n^2}.
\end{equation}
Here, the load inertia and the inertia of the motor are separated and the motor
inertia from the datasheet is presumed to be correct, leaving only the load
inertia as an unknown.  Now the relations between the motor parameters and the
time performance can be seen. The time constant is given by the term
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:timeconstant}
    \frac {J_t} { \frac {k^2} {R} + d}
\end{equation}
and as such contains all the parameters of the motor. According to the final
value theorem, the steady state value from a step input is given by setting
$s=0$ and therefore the steady state gain is given by 
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:steadystate}
    k (1 + \frac{1}{Rd}).
\end{equation}
This contains only one unknown parameter. Therefore, to estimate the viscous
friction parameter $d$, it is suitable to examine and match the steady state
rotational speed of the real system and the model. Since this model contains no
static friction which is probably present in the real system, the test is
conducted at maximum permissable input voltage to minimize the disturbances in
the test data. Since the desired value does not depend on frequency, only a
square wave input is used to simulate steps in both directions. \par
Now that the friction parameter is presumed to be correct and fixed, the time
constant in Equation (\ref{eq:timeconstant}) only has one unknown, the load
inertia. This is estimated from taking the time constant from step inputs,
simulated by a square wave signal. Again, to minimize model disturbances caused
by the static friction present in the real system, the square wave is run at a
full 24 V.\\
The tuning can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:l1_sq_a24_f016}. After the viscous
friction is modeled, values on the inertia of the system is adjusted to fit the
real motor. The end result after the parameters have been tuned can be seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:l1_sq_a24_f016}.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=100mm]{l1_sq_a24_f016.png}
    \caption{Velocity output from the motor and the model when tuned for
    both viscous friction and inertia.}
    \label{fig:l1_sq_a24_f016}
\end{figure}
After tuning, the inertia of the load is found to be $6\cdot10^{-5}$ kgm2
and the viscous friction is $1.35\cdot10^{-1}$ Nms/rad. The problem with this linear
friction model is that even though it can be made to fit a certain velocity
level set point, because of the nonlinearity in the real system the model
performance will differ when it is run further away
from the set point. In Figure~\ref{fig:parameter_id_bad}, the system is run with
the same parameters but at a lower voltage, yielding big discrepancies between
the model and the system.
\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{Model performance when not at set point.}
    \label{fig:parameter_id_bad}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Level 2}
\label{sub:level_2}
As could be seen in the earlier friction model, it did not incorporate the
effects of static friction which led to inaccuracy in the model when varying the
rotational speed. A model which captures the real behaviour of the system is
used here, called the Karnop friction model. In addition to the linear friction,
the static friction is taken into account by adding a stick-slip zone where the
friction tourque is equal to the applied torque. The model is given by the
equation
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:karnop}
    M_f = d \dot{\phi} + F_c sgn(\dot{\phi}),
\end{equation}
with the friction torque $M_f$ and the static friction $F_c$. This
friction is the maximum static friction torque that can be applied in
the stick slip zone.  There is now one more design parameter that needs
to be tuned, $F_c$.  The linear friction is still most prominent when at
high velocities and the static friction is the strongest when at low
velocities. The inertia is decided solely from the rise time and should
not differ much from the previous model. Firstly, the step response to
a 5 V square wave is examined to determine the static friction. When the
static friction is set, the response to a square wave at 24 V is
examined and $d$ is adjusted to fit the viscous friction. A sine of low
amplitude is then run to test the behaviour around the stick slip area,
i.e.  at low speeds.\par
The stick slip zone span is set to be 1 rad/s. The new viscous friction is then
$1\cdot 10^{-5}$ Nms/rad and the static friction is $1.5\cdot 10^{-3}$ Nm.
In Figure~\ref{fig:l2_sq_a24_f016_fcTuned} the tuned model is run at the full
voltage range of the motor. The model follows the real plant very well.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=100mm]{l2_sq_a24_f016_fcTuned.png}
    \caption{Velocity response of motor and model at 24V amplitude when
    tuned for both static and dynamic friction.}
    \label{fig:l2_sq_a24_f016_fcTuned}
\end{figure}
To verify that the model works also at voltages outside the set point, the model
is run at a 5 V amplitude. The result is displayed in
Figure~\ref{fig:l2_sq_a5_f016_fctuned}.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{l2_sq_a5_f016_fctuned.png}
    \caption{Model compared to system when at low voltages.}
    \label{fig:l2_sq_a5_f016_fctuned}
\end{figure}
The model performance is substantially improved from the linear model, even
outside the set points. The model perfomance during sine input is displayed in
Figure~\ref{fig:l2_sin_a5_f1}.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=100mm]{l2_sin_a5_f1.png}
    \caption{Velocity response of a sine wave at 5V amplitude of the
    motor and tuned model}
    \label{fig:l2_sin_a5_f1}
\end{figure} 
The inflexion points when the voltage is too low to overcome the static friction
is captured by the model.

\section*{Velocity control}
\label{sec:velocity_control}
The parameters generated in the previous section are used to design the
controller for the motor. For the design, a simplified model without motor
inductance is used in \textsc{Matlab} to place the poles and estimate the
behaviour of the system. Furthermore, a non-linear model with Karnop friction is
used in \textsc{Simulink} to simulate the behaviour of the system with the
controller implemented. Finally, the design is run on the actual motor for
verification of plant model and controller.
\subsection*{Level 1}
\label{sub:velocity_level_1}
Controlling the velocity is done with a PI controller. To best control the
performance, the controller is designed in discrete time. \par
The rule of thumb for sample time of a system states that the system should be
sampled at 4-10 times the rise time of the plant in open loop. Using the
simplified model in \textsc{Matlab} and the commando \texttt{stepinfo}, the rise
time is extracted and the sampling time is set to 10 times the rise time. \par
To get the desired performance of the closed loop system, the poles are placed
directly in the discrete plane. First, the plant is converted from continuous to
discrete space by Zero Order Hold (ZOH), with the sampling time derived
earlier.The new sytem matrices are given by the equations
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:phi}
    \Phi = e^{AT_s}
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:gamma}
    \Gamma = \int_0^{T_s}{e^{A(t-s)}B\text{ds}}.
\end{equation}
Output feedback is used to create the closed loop system. 
% Insert figure of output feedback here
The model of the plant is given in (\ref{eq:motormodel}) and is here rewritten as
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:motorsimple}
    \frac{B}{A}=\frac{a}{s + b}
\end{equation}
,to simplify the equations. 
Firstly, the feedback polynomial $\frac{S}{R}$ is derived. This is given by
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:feedback_vel}
    \frac{S}{R}=\frac{s_1z + s_0}{z - 1}.
\end{equation}
The system is then closed, yielding the pole polynomial
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:polepolynomial_vel}
    AR + BS = z^2+(as_1+b-1)z+as_0-b.
\end{equation}
The system is of order one so one closed loop pole given by 
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:am_vel}
    A_m = z - p_1
\end{equation}
is placed with an additional pole given by the observer polynomial 
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:ao_vel}
    A_o = z - p_2
\end{equation}
This yields the Diophantine equation
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:diophantine_vel}
    A_mA_o = AR + BS.
\end{equation}
Solving for (\ref{eq:diophantine_vel}) the unknown controller parameters $s_0$
and $s_1$ are found to be
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:s0_vel}
    s_0 = \frac{p1p2+b}{a}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:s1_vel}
    s_1 = -\frac{b + p_1 + p_2 -1}{a}.
\end{equation}
The $T$ polynomial is given by 
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:T_vel}
    T = t_0A_o
\end{equation}
where $t_0$ is a static value so that the steady state gain of the closed loop
system is 1. Using the final-value theorem for discrete systems, one yields
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:t0_vel}
    t0 = \left (\frac{B}{A_m} \right )^{-1}
\end{equation}
evaluated in $z=1$. The control law is then found as,
\begin{equation}
    R(z)u(z)=T(z)r(z)-S(z)y(z)
    \label{eq:contlaw}
\end{equation}
and in numerical form,
\begin{equation}
    (z-1)U(z)=t_0(0.420z-0.376)r(z)-(0.533z - 0.489)y(z)
\end{equation}


In Figure~\ref{fig:T2_a50_f05:a} is the response from a square wave with
50 rad/s and 0.5Hz shown. In Figure~\ref{fig:T2_a50_f05:b} the voltage
response for the same input is plotted.

 It can also be seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:T2_a50_f05_ss} the plot that the
steady state error is less than the specified 0.5 rad/s. And that there
is no overshoot.

  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{Response for sine wave 10 rad/s and 0.2Hz}
  \label{fig:T2_a10_f02_load}
\end{figure}
The controller follows the sine input well when undisturbed. When disturbing the
motor with an extra load, it sources much more voltage and does not always have
the power to negate the disturbances.

\section*{Position Control}
The open loop system for the is reached by integrating the velocity system.
Therefore, the system contains a pure integrator pole. The new system is written
as
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:possystem}
    G(s) = \frac{a_c}{s^2+b_c s}
\end{equation}
in the continuous case. To find a suitable sampling rate, the bandwidth of the
open loop controller is examined using a Bode plot and the sampling rate is
chosen to be 10-30 times faster. With a bandwidth of 5.78, the sampling rate is
chosen as 10 times this. The final sampling time is then 0.11 s. Finally, before
the control design is done, the system is sampled with ZOH, yielding the system
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:discretepos}
    G_0(z) = \frac{a z + b}{z^2 + cz + d},
\end{equation}
where the numerical values are discplayed in the table below.
\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \caption{Numerical values of discretized closed loop system.}
    \label{tab:discretetable}
    \begin{tabular}{|c  | c |}
        \hline
        a &  0.421 \\
        \hline
        b & 0.389 \\
        \hline
        c & -0.20 \\
        \hline
        d & 0.01 \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}
  \subsection*{Level 1} 
  For this control, a discrete PID controller is used with transfer function
  \begin{equation}
      \label{eq:PIDdiscrete}
      \frac{S}{R} = \frac{s_2 z^2 + s_1 z + s_0}{(z-1)(z+r_0)}.
  \end{equation}
  The control design process is similar to the one used with the velocity
  controller with the addition of a higher order system. 
  The resulting control law becomes
  \begin{equation}
      \big((z-1)(z+0.784)\big)u(z)=(13.1z^2-14.9z+4.87)r(z)-(3.06z^2)y(z)
  \end{equation}
  where the observer polynomial and the closed loop polynomial is,
  \begin{align*}
        &A_m = (z-0.1)(z-0.1)\\
        &A_o = z^2.
  \end{align*}
  In Figure~\ref{fig:pos_l1:a} the response from
  the controller can be seen and in Figure~\ref{fig:pos_l1V:b} the
  voltage response is plotted. 
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering

    \label{fig:pos_l1V:b}
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{Response from position controller}
  \label{fig:pos_cont}
\end{figure}
This system has a rise time of 0.33 s, overshoot of 0.08 (2\%) and a minimal
steady state error, though it occasionally, but not always, has some 
oscillations.

\subsection*{Level 2}
The controller used in level 1 is designed directly in the discrete plane. To
compare admissable sampling times, a continuous time controller is designed and
then discretized with Tustins approximation. \par
The design steps are the same as the output feedback design in the velocity
controller case and are therefore not stated again. For the feedback controller,
a continuous PID with low pass filter is chosen,
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:contpid}
    \frac{S}{R} = \frac{s_2 s^2 + s_1 s + s_0}{s(s+_0)}.
\end{equation}
The Diophantine equation yields the parameter values
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:r0pos}
    r_0 = 2\omega_3 \zeta - b + \omega_1 + \omega_2, 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:s0pos}
    s_0 = \frac{\omega_1 \omega_2 \omega_3^2}{a},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:s1pos}
    s_1 = \frac{\omega_3 (2\omega_1 \omega_2 \zeta + \omega_1 \omega_3 +
    \omega_2 \omega_3)}{a},
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:s2pos}
    s_2 = \frac{1}{a} ( -2b\omega_3 \zeta + 2\omega_1 \omega_3 \zeta + 2\omega_2
    \omega_3 \zeta + b^2 - b\omega_2 \omega_1 \omega_2 \omega_3^2),
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:contpoles}
    A_m A_{o} = (s + \omega_1)(s + \omega_2)(s^2 + 2\omega_3\zeta s +
    \omega_3^2).
\end{equation}
The feedback polynomial becomes
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:cont_feedback}
    \frac{T}{R} = \frac{t_0 (s^2 + 2\omega_3\zeta s + \omega_3^2)}{s(s + r_0)}.
\end{equation}
Designing the controller is done by iteration and testing. Firstly, the speed
and performance of the system is set by moving the $A_m$ polynomial so that a
good mix of model disturbance and sensor noice rejection is found. The closed
loop poles in $A_o$ are then placed to get the desired performance. The sampling
rate is first set by the thumbrule that it should be 10-30 times faster than the
fastest pole in the system, then it is tuned to see what the maximum reachable
sampling time is while maintaining the perfomance within specifications. The
controllers are approximated using the sampling time and tested on the physical
plant. The resulting control law, sampling time and perfomance is displayed
below. \par The control law, given  in the same form as in Equation
(\ref{eq:contlaw}), is
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:pos_controllaw}
    (z^2 - 0.895z - 0.105) u(z) = (12.1z^2 - 9.21z + 1.75)r(z) - (114z^2 - 187z
    + 77.7)y(z)
\end{equation}
with the input $u(z)$, reference $r(z)$ and the output $y(z)$. The closed loop
system has a double pole in -18 and the observer polynomial has a real double
pole in -45. The samlpling time is 0.02 s. The step response with corresponding
voltage input is given below
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{continuous_level2.png}
    \caption{Step response of continuous system approximated with Tustin.}
    \label{fig:continuous_level2}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{continuous_level2_voltage.png}
    \caption{Voltage input of continuous system approximated with Tustin.}
    \label{fig:continuous_level2_voltage}
\end{figure}
This system has a rise time of 0.31 s, an overshoot of 0.02 and no steady state
error and as such fulfills the system requirements. \par
It can be seen that the sampling period can be made substantially longer when
designing the system directly in the discrete plane. Since the sampling time in
the continuous system is set by the fastest poles in the system, it is very
dependant on the system in question. In this case, the observer polynomial was
rather fast, greatly limiting the available sampling time. Furthermore, the use
of approximations for the controllers may cause different mapping of poles
depending in the sampling rate, putting further constraints on what sampling
times are available. In this case Tustins approximation is used which always
maps stable continuous poles to stable discrete poles but the Euler
approximations are not guaranteed to do this.
